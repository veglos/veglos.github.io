I am a Chilean software engineer with more than a decade of professional experience and I am passionate about software architecture and best practices.
This blog's main purpose is to remind me of pieces of code I have put together and why I took some decisions so I don't have to google the information all over again when I'm building something similar.
I am proud to share this knowledge with much love to everyone in the world.
